== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Jigoshop work with X theme? =

Jigoshop will in theory work with any theme, but of course, certain parts may need to be styled using CSS to make them match up. We've added default styling for Twentyten (the WordPress default theme) and we also provide a few bespoke themes optimised for Jigoshop.

If you need a theme built, or have a theme that needs styling, give us a shout and we may be able to assist (see http://jigowatt.co.uk/contact/).

= Can I have Jigoshop in my language =

Jigoshop comes with a .po file and is localisation ready. If you'd like to share your localisation with us please get in touch!

= Do you have an X payment gateway = 

We will be introducing payment gateways incrementally, however, not all will be in the free version. If you want to request a payment gateway, or you have built one and you would like to share it with us, please get in touch.

= Do I have access to my order and product data? = 

Orders and products are stored as custom post types in the WordPress database; you have full control of them and can import/export using WordPress' functions.

= Will tax settings work in my country? = 

Jigoshop has a flexible tax rule system which allows you to define tax rates per country - it should allow you to do what you want.
